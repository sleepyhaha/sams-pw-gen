# Week 3 Challenge - Sam S

# Description

This week's challenge is to refactor existing code to get a random password generator working. This challenge has helped me with getting my head around basic Javascript concepts such as writing functions, for loops and if/else statements.

The password generator will generate a password according to the parameters set by the user through a series of prompts.

Clicking the generate password button will prompt the user to enter the length of their desired password, and cycle through whether they would like to include lower or upper case characters, numbers or special characters.

The script will then display the password within the "Your Secure Password" box.
